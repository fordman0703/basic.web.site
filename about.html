Hello and welcome to the About me Page.  <p>Thank you for taking time out of your busy day to come and view my web page. I know that it is time consuming and you may not feel like you would rather watch paint dry, that is fine. Watching paing dry can be fun and entertaining as long as while you're watching it dry, you're thowing paint at somone else in the room with you.   <p>
    <p> If you don't have someone in the room to throw paint on then you could always be productive and clean up all the drop cloths and you can also clean up your work area. All of this should and could be done in a timely manner unless all you really feel like doing is goofing off. </p></div>
